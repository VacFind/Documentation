# Link Aggregation
VacFind is maintaining a database of links and resources that may be helpful to the community. These are displayed on our site and include:
- Any volunteer-run COVID-relief projects that we come across
- Resources that may be helpful to developers of COVID relief projects (such as grants and freebies)

This data is also offered through our [api](../Database/api) and the airtable schema is documented [here](../Database/links).

Feel free to reach out if you have any concerns or would like to discuss this further
