## Contributions

These docs are [on github](https://github.com/VacFind/Documentation).

These docs exist tas a place for both general documentation about VacFind that doesnt really go anywhere else (like in a specific repo) as well as to create a wiki-like site of information and resources that can help volunteers and developers get started with creating or contributing to services like ours in their own states.

### Some ideas for new entries

- Possibly add bios or introductions for each project so newcomers can learn know who is who in this space and where each group needs help without bothering the owners (as much)
