## How to search for other COVID Vaccine apps when they wont show up on google

Well, if youre looking for other COVID vaccine tracking apps, you could just use https://VacFind.org, since we've already done this.


Nevertheless here are some steps:

1. generate a list of the domains you want to check via your favorite method. If theres enough interest I can make a python script to make this easier.
2. use a bulk WHOIS tool like [this](https://www.bulkseotools.com/bulk-whois-lookup.php) to look up who registered the domains
   - you may want to copy this into a spreadsheet when its done
3. Filter out anything that is not registered. you may want to set them aside in case they become registered in future
4. if theres a lot of links, you can paste them into a [bulk URL opening tool](https://www.10bestseo.com/url-opener/). *NOTE*, this may make your screen flash as it opens the webpages, especially if you use dark mode.
5. go through each of the opened pages to see which ones are available. Generally you get one of three results:
	- the webpage is unable to connect (this can mean many things, but can be considered the same as "unregistered" for this purpose)
	- you see a domain registrar holding page (this could mean the domain was recently registered, or registered and never pointed at anything. these could be interpereted as "coming soon")
	- an actual webpage (sometimes this is a generic coming soon page)
6. possibly repeat with another domain name format
